Air Quality Index Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression


Project Description
This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using various air pollutants such as CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, PM2.5, and PM10. The dataset used is based on hourly air quality readings from New York.
The model is evaluated using key metrics:
R² (Coefficient of Determination)
MSE (Mean Squared Error)
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
The project also includes data visualization to understand feature distributions and model behavior.

🧠 Learning Objectives
Understand how multiple features impact AQI
Build and evaluate a regression model using scikit-learn
Visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn
Create and interpret radar plots
